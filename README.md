# PYTHON üêç

### So, This reprository it's to save and show some projects of data analysis I created using the colab ide and the python language.  You can see more details about how the analyses proceded and the libraries used, opening the notebooks. üíÉ 
### I made 4 Machine Learning Model in the "Linear Regression", "Deep learning" and "reinforcement learning" projects, a Business Analysis in the notebook "Sales" and analysed the Financial Cost in the "House Rent".
##
## A PREVIEW OF WHAT YOU WILL FIND: 
### Deep Learning
#### This is a classification algorithm that predicts the class referring to the image we send. I trained the model to learn the caracters for 10 classes ('airplane', 'automobile', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck') then I send a picture of a car and asked that what class the photo belongs.
##
### Reinforcement Learning
#### This is a model that can buy, sells or keep the stock, based on stock price data. 
##
### *Linear Regression*
#### Well, in this work I made a machine learning model with linear regression that predicts the Price of a house based on some imputs, like Population, quantity of rooms ans bathrooms, house area and house age.
#### Below here, there's the model plot along with the real answer and you can see that the model variable (Green) is realy close to the real one (Blue)

### *Sales*
#### I analysed the Sales of an Eletronic Store. I evaluated the products, departments and sourse who saled more in a 4 consecutive monthes. Just as some client data like the medium of age and income.
#### First I had some business premisses to consider. Due to an error in the database system some clients had their city information not computed. To fix this, I consider this people to have an specif Uf (called MT).
#### In this preview I wanna show you the remarkable diference between the same graphics ploted using diferents library
#### The first correspond to a plot using plotly and the one bellow is using matplotlib. You can see that the data are more organized in the first picture (using plotly)

#### Another comparision between the two library

#### Here is the code we use to plot matplotlid and bellow it using less lines with plotly

### *House Rent*
#### I analysed the rent price in two citys: Porto and Barcelona
#### Bellow, there's a histogram that I plot counting tha number of houses with tha specific rent. We can see that Barcelona offers a great amount of options from lower to larger price rent.
