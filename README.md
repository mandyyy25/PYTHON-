# PYTHON 🐍

### So, This reprository it's to save and show some projects of data analysis I created using the colab ide and the python language. I want you to you to feel the right to give your feedback whether it relays on positive or negative (I'm willing to take any assessment as an opportunitie to get better more and more). You can see more details about how the analyses proceded opening the notebooks. 💃 
### I made a Machine Learning Model in the "Linear Regression" projects, a Business Analysis in the notebook "Sales" and analysed the Financial Cost in the "House Rent".

# A PREVIEW OF WHAT YOU WILL FIND: 
## *Linear Regression*
### Here I ploted the model along with the real answer and you can see that the model variable (Green) is realy close to the real one (Blue)

## *Liner Regression 2*
## *Sales*
### I analysed the Sales of an Eletronic Store
### First I wanna show you the remarkable diference between the same graphics ploted using diferents library
### The first correspond to a plot using plotly and the one bellow is using matplotlib. You can see that the data are more organized in the first picture (using plotly)

## *House Rent*
### I analysed the rent price in two citys: Porto and Barcelona
### Bellow, there's a histogram that I plot counting tha number of houses with tha specific rent. We can see that Barcelona offers a great amount of options from lower to larger price rent.

 I had to stablish some changes in the databases due to an error in the data collection.
